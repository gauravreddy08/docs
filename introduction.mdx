## What is Vector Database API?

Vector Database API is a high-performance, RESTful API designed for storing, indexing, and searching vector embeddings. Built with Python and FastAPI, it provides a clean, domain-driven architecture that makes it easy to implement similarity search capabilities in your applications.

## Architecture Overview

The Vector Database API follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with clean separation of concerns:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Domain Layer">
    Core entities (Chunk, Document, Library) and business rules defined in `app/domain/`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Service Layer">
    Business logic implementation in `app/services/` that orchestrates operations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Repository Layer">
    Data access abstraction in `app/repositories/` with in-memory implementations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Layer">
    FastAPI endpoints in `app/api/` that handle HTTP requests and responses
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Overview

The API organizes data into three main concepts:

- **Libraries**: Top-level containers that group related documents and define indexing strategy
- **Documents**: Collections of chunks with associated metadata  
- **Chunks**: Individual text pieces with vector embeddings and metadata for searching

<Note>
  Vector embeddings are automatically generated using the Cohere API when you create chunks with text content.
